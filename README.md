# hpc-discrete-event-simulator

This repository is a discrete event simulator for simulating an HPC environment.  Jobs and machines are loaded from a .csv files.  The DES class implements the following scheudling algorithms: first-come-first-serve, shortest job first, and best fit bin packing.  The DES class can be extended to allow additional scheduling algorithms if desired.

To see how it works and run the code, execute the test.py file.
